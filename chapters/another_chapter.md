# Another chapter

This is another chapter.[^numbering] It also has a little code fencing, mainly to test an edge case where math syntax appears in a non-math context:

```console
$ find . \( -name \*.gemspec -or -name \*.jpg \) -type f
```

[^numbering]: Footnotes are numbered on a per-chapter basis.
